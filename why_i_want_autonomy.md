  <h1>Why I Want Autonomy</h1>

  <p>I’m not trying to escape responsibility. I’m trying to claim it. This space is a living document of who I am, what I’m working toward, and why autonomy isn’t a rebellion or a complaint it’s a right I’m earning.</p>

  <h2>1. I understand myself.</h2>
  <p>I know what I value, and I reflect constantly. I'm not reckless. I'm building my identity intentionally. That includes mistakes, reflection, and growth.</p>

  <h2>2. I have goals.</h2>
  <p>I want to major in business or data science. I’ve earned 30+ service hours and am pushing for 110. I'm active in robotics, contributing to fundraisers and outreach. I care about where I’m going.</p>

  <h2>3. Guardianship misrepresents me.</h2>
  <p>Being placed under it without fully being heard or respected strips me of trust and voice. I'm not dangerous, out of control, or incompetent. I'm someone trying to live with clarity and purpose.</p>

  <h2>4. I’m creating systems of documentation.</h2>
  <p>This GitHub is part of that. I'm building a record of my thoughts, efforts, and growth. I’ve made personal blogs, documented patterns, and started organizing my story. Not to be dramatic — but to be *seen*.</p>

  <h2>5. I want connection, not control.</h2>
  <p>I'm not here to cause harm. I want to connect meaningfully. But real connection means space, understanding, and honesty,  not constant supervision or being boxed in.</p>
